# Implementation-of-a-Search-Engine-using-Trie-Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-in-JAVA
Implemented a simplified Web Search Engine for the pages of a small Web site. A web crawler was implemented to gather information about these pages and store them in a dictionary known as inverted index. Inverted Index was implemented with Trie Data Structure for storing the index terms. When a single keyword or multiple keywords query is given, the search engine gives the pages containing all the given keywords. The occurrence list of each keyword was retrieved using the Trie. In addition to that ranking of pages has been implemented based on relevancy
